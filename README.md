# Runner's Movement Recognition | Machine Learning
Runner's Machine Learning is real-time movement recognition project. The project is resulted in classification of walking, running and squats with 96% success on our dataset. The project is continuum of [Runner's Android Application](https://github.com/hakaneroztekin/runners-android-app/).

## Tools & Techs Used
**Software:** Python (keras, tensorflow, sklearn, matplotlib), Brackets, Anaconda, Socket.io, WebStorm

**Algorithms:** Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Random Forest (RF). Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used before RF, but RF has chosen over SVM for its running speed. 

**Hardware:** Bluno, soft sensors and microcontrollers

## Project Poster
**This project is selected among the best projects of the year.** Decision is made by the professors of our faculty after the presentations ([here](/Presentation.pptx) is mine) and then we've prepared project posters to present it to the company owners. You can access the project poster [here](/Poster.pptx). 

## Back story
I have developed the app as my Computer Engineering graduation project. I've developed an android app to show movement data to the user in real-time. I wanted to improve myself on artificial intelligence and contribute to the society. This idea was proposed to me by my advisor and just after that moment I have started working on it. There's a long way to walk, though I enjoyed working on the project and learning about artificial intelligence and also python.

## Public Use
Unfortunately, the application is developed for a private project held by my faculty (Computer Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul/Turkey). I have created this repository to share the insights and my work during my graduation project.
